# tor on windows

The PDF contains a guide on how to setup Tor as
a nice auto-starting background service on windows.

I put the HTML version of the PDF here too, just-in-caseâ„¢.

you can download [tor](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tor)
and keep it updated from [chocolatey.](https://chocolatey.org/)

[Here is a link to that article.](https://miloserdov.org/?p=1839)

There is also a recent version of Tor included, in-case the links go down.
